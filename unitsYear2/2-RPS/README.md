##Instructions

You are given Starter Code for this project which you must clone into your own workspace.
You will notice that there are comments inside the script.js file that provide instructions for how components of this project should be made.  

####In order to make Rock, Paper, Scissors functional you will need to complete the three tasks below:

###1) Clone this repo into your own Cloud9 account workspace
1. Copy the "clone URL" from this repo
2. In your Cloud9 dashboard click on the green "Create New Workspace" button and select "Clone from URL"

Once the workspace has been processed check to be sure it is up to date by running ` git status ` in the terminal. You should receive a messege telling you that your branch is up to date.

**NOTE: It is common practice to push you changes to your GitHub repository often. It is recommended you make a push after every major change. Through the course of completing this project you should make 7-10 pushes to GitHub. Your manager will be grading you on this.**

To push to GitHub run the following commands in your terminal:  
`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`


###2) index.html
The HTML file in this repo is not fully complete as of right now. Follow the comments within the file before moving on to the script.js file.

###3) script.js
Use the comments within the script.js file to help you complete the missing components of this game. Luckily, the former intern left very detailed comments that are easy to follow.

###Bonus) 
Your Manager has offered a stipend a $500 for each of the bonus requirements listed below: 

* Add CSS to this project using Bootstrap. Give it it's own theme
* Create a game with more variety in throwing opitons. Example: [Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock)
