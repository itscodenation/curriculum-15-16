This project will be created in the process of completing [lesson 1](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2015/tree/master/units/14-javascript2_2/lessons/1-hash) & [lesson 2](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/curriculum2015/tree/master/units/14-javascript2_2/lessons/2-hashes) of this unit.

The final work product should be a webpage with a simple form and submit button. 

Once the user types in a Country name the following information should display:

* Capital
* National Animal
* National Language
* Population 

##Scope

The focus of this project is to create a simple webpage that uses jQuery and an object to print out information of a country based on a user's request.


##Before Class

### Prerequisites
Students should only start this project after they have ran through the lessons associated with this unit and jQuery.

### Starter code

There is no starter code for this project.

### Solution code

See [here](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions2015/tree/master/year1/14-javascript2_2/project-aroundTheWorld) for code (private).

### Assessment

1. Student's websites will be assessed based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rSyrqf3E3knsAu-G7bdrI9JrSC5eOpuADYrTD8H4Kfg/edit?usp=sharing).
 
###Build Time
Students will work alone on this project. The teacher's role will be to walk around the room helping students with any questions they have. Students are encouraged to look at previous lessons for reference.

Be sure to encourage student to push changes to GitHub often using this process:

`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`  
`git push origin master`

###Extension Project
For students who are looking for an extra challenge they can build on this project by...

* Adding images of country data
* Adding Bootstrap for design
* Use Key Bindings to allow the user to hit enter

To see an example of a completed extension project navigate to the [solutions repository](https://github.com/ScriptEdcurriculum/solutions2015/tree/master/14-javascript2_2/lessons/3-project) for code (private)

##Closing
Select students to present their work to the class.

###Check for Understanding
Teachers should keep track of student success while they are presenting to the class based on [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rSyrqf3E3knsAu-G7bdrI9JrSC5eOpuADYrTD8H4Kfg/edit?usp=sharing).

###How to Submit
Students must push all final code to their GitHub repository. To push changes in Cloud 9 the following commands must be run in the terminal:

`git status`  
`git add .`  
`git commit -m "example comment"`
