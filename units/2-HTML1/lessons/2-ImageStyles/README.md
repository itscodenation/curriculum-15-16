## Before class
---
###Teacher Preperation
* The teacher must sign up for a free account with Cloud9 IDE. Familiarize yourself with the environment. 
* The teacher should create a webpage with some text and 2 pictures on Cloud9 IDE.
* Review what was covered last lesson to understand the level of skill students have with HTML. 


### Daily Objective

* Students will be able to create a webpage that includes one relative image and one absolute image.
* Students will be able to add simple styles to their webpage using the style tag. 


### Key points

* A relative URL is saved locally within your library.
* An absolute URL is a link to something saved online.
* CSS adds styles to our webpages. Normally we link to a style sheet but today we will use quick styles in a style tag

### Assessment

1. Review each student’s webpage after class 



### Vocabulary

* Absolute URL
* Relative URL
* CSS
* IDE (Intergrated Development Environment)
* img src=

###References
* [Cloud 9 and GitHub Setup](/resources/c9)
* <https://c9.io/> 


## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance: Teacher takes student attendance at www.kinvolved.com
2. Hand students a [Cloud 9 and GitHub Setup](https://github.com/kirjs/curriculum/blob/master/resources/c9/README.md) worksheet. Students will sign up for GitHub and Cloud9 with help from this worksheet.


## Opening

* “Now that everyone has set up a GitHub and Cloud 9 account let’s set what we are looking at.” The teacher should explain how Cloud 9 is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that allows us to easily edit and view our webpage in one window. Do not spend too much time explaining GitHub at this point. It will be covered later in the year.    
* The teacher will want to provide a quick demo of how to create workspaces, folders, files, save file, etc. while using Cloud 9.

## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)

**Ask students to close computer screens** “We are going to take our firstpage.html project from last class and add two pictures to it.. later in class we will add some CSS styles too” On the board create a new workspace in Cloud9. Make sure to create a folder and new file with a .html extension. **It is important to show students how to properly organize/save files right from the start.** 

Demonstrate, in front of the class, how to add a picture to an absolute image (an image linked online) to a webpage using  the img src= tag. After placing that picture in also place a relative image on this page (an image saved locally) You should ask questions such as:

* How does this tag differ from other tags we have used so far?
* Where is this image located? Both on the page and where is it saved?


## Guided Practice (“We Do”)

“Let’s all open up Cloud9 and create a place to work on this project.” All together, create a new workspace (this tends to take a lot of time to process on Cloud9) to house this html project. Students should also find a picture they can save in a folder labeled images.

## Independent practice ("You do")

Ask all students to create a page with the following criteria:

* A title
* A heading
* 2 pictures (1 absolute and 1 relative) both with text under them.

During this time teachers will circulate to help students with technical issues. If a majority of the class is struggling with the same issue you may consider demonstrating the solution on the board.


## Introduction of new material #2 (“I Do”)

“Looks great! Everyone has a webpage with two images and text. Now we are going to add some style to this page. To do this we are going to need a new tag and a whole new set of styles that go inside the tag.” With student’s screens shut, demonstrate where a style tag must go and the syntax behind styling a portion of the page.

Main talking points of the demonstration/lecture are:

* The style tag is inside the head tag
* In order to specify which part of the page to style you must use a selector (h1 in the example above) and curly brackets.
* There are many types of styles ranging from color, text-align, size, etc. 

## Guided Practice #2(“We Do”)

“Let’s all together add a style tag inside the head of your page and set the background color to blue.”

## Independent practice #2("You do")

After students have applied 1 style to their page they are ready to style the page on their own. Provide a bank of style properties (some are listed below). Tell the students they have the rest of class to add a minimum of the following styles to their page:


* At least one style that applies only the paragraph text
* At least two styles that apply to the entire body
* At least one style that is not provided to them. Encourage them to research CSS style properties. (www.w3schools.com is a great resource)

During the time while students are adding styles the teacher will circulate to help with technical issues and encourage students to push their abilities.

## Closing/ Homework
“Today we created a HTML webpage with multiple tags and style types. Would anyone like to share what they have done and explain how they did it?”

## Check for understanding
Students must share their site with the teacher for your review.

##Homework
Encourage students to log into their Cloud9 account at home and use w3schools to learn anything they can outside of class.
 
## After Class
* Take a quick look at each webpage project from today. Students who were not able to create the page should be asked to recreate it, with teacher’s help, next class.
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
