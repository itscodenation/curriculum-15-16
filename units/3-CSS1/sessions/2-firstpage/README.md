## Before class
---
###Teacher Preperation
* The teacher should become familiar with dash.ga.co project 2. Walking through this project should take an experienced html user 20-30 minutes. 
* Pay close attention to the JS like buttons in this project. They will not function outside of the General Assembly site.
* Review what was covered last lesson to understand the level of skill students have with HTML. 

### Daily Objective

* Students will be able to create a webpage that includes a header section, several styles and JavaScript buttons while working in the General Assembly tutorial environment. 


### Key points

* head, header and h1 tags sound similar but are completely different things.
* JavaScript is the language used to make webpages interactive.
* A media query is a useful tool for making a website mobile friendly.


### Assessment

1. Worksheet to accompany dash.ga.co tutorial (see references)
2. Site made in Cloud9 IDE after completing walkthrough. (to be completed in the following lesson)



### Vocabulary

* Header
* Media Query
* JavaScript

## During class

### Do-now

1. Volunteer takes attendance. [Procedure found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IIhqykr70vj7wnqyJYuQNTkd9GX56Xgl3omD42IcMk/edit).
2. Give each student a General Assembly walkthrough worksheet (see references).
3. Have students log onto dash.ga.co to set up a free account.


## Opening

“Now that everyone has set up a General Assembly account, let’s see what we are going to do with this site.” As a class, read the directions at the top of the General Assembly worksheet.

## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)
On the screen, open up the General Assembly site and provide a quick explanation as to why it is a useful tool for learning. Consider playing the 1 minute intro video on the site.



## Guided Practice (“We Do”)

Walk through the first 4-5 slides with he students on the board to show how the tutorial tells you what to type BUT also becomes less helpful as the tutorial progresses. Be sure to also point out the importance of answering the questions on the worksheet as you complete the tutorial.

## Independent practice ("You do")

•	Students should use the rest of class to complete sections 1, 2 & 3 of project 2. **There is no need for the average student to work through project 1!** However it could be useful for a student who is falling behind to complete this project first.

During this time teachers will circulate to help students with technical issues. If a majority of the class is struggling with the same issue you may consider demonstrating the solution on the board.  

**Note:** This is a long period of time for a teenager to be completing a single task. Some may need an occasional break from time-to-time. Feel free to have a quick off-topic conversation with a student if you see them struggling to focus.

## Closing
After completing sections 1, 2 & 3 students should begin working on the Activity at the bottom of the Walkthrough worksheet; which reads:

Although students can get started now, this will be the topic of next class so students should not get too carried away as of right now.

## Check for understanding
Leave about 5 minutes at the end of class for there to be a discussion about what was learned today by completing a tutorial on General Assembly.

##Homework
Students who are not complete with the tutorial and/or the worksheet by the end of class should complete it at home for homework.
 
## After Class

* Teachers must provide a grade for the tutorial worksheet. It is crutial to provide this feedback so that students will see the value of their work.

* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
