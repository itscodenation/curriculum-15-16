#Unit 4 - Programming with Scratch

##Synopsis
In this unit, the students begin work on Scratch 2.0. Scratch is a block based programming language that allows for visual representation of a computer program without using any syntax. Through three quick activities in Scratch the students will obtain a base knowledge in creating Algorithms, Boolean Logic and Variables.
