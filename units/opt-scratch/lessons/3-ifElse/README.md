## Before class
---
###Teacher Preperation
* A further understanding of Scratch. Teacher should be familiar with control, sensing and data blocks.
* The teacher should create a two variable MadLibs program with a logic condition before entering the classroom.


### Daily Objective
 
* Student will be able to implement Boolean logic using an if/else block in a Scratch program. 

### Key points


* If/Else statements let us set a condition and execute different code based on whether the condition is met.

### Assessment

1. Student created program in Scratch that uses If/Else statements


### Vocabulary

* Logic
* Boolean

## During class

### Do-now

1. Attendance
2. Students are instructed to write a sentence using if/else. Any sentence that uses the words **if, then & else.**

## Opening

Ask students to share their if/else statements with the class. The teacher should write some sentences on the board. Try to emphasis words with a different color font.

Ex: **If** it is raining **then** I will take my umbrella, **else** I will wear flip flops.

## Introduction of new material (“I Do”)

In a demonstration, the teachers will "act out" a simple demonstration of if, else, else. A simple and fun demonstration is as follows:

"**If** no one's hand is raised, teacher 1 will do a robot dance. **If** every student's hand is raised, teacher 2 will dance salsa. **Else**, all the teachers will square dance."

## Guided Practice ("We do")

Scratch, along with every programming language in the world, uses if/else states to create boolean logic. Scratch has a block we can use to implement this logic. 

The teacher should create the program below on the board:

## Independent practice ("You do")

By the end of class, Students should create a program that asks the user if they would like various flavors of ice cream.

**Extension Activity** Students can create a game in Scratch using if/else. By changing the color of the background in certain areas a game can be made that has Scratchy the cat say something dependant of we he is on the stage. A great example of a game like this made in Scratch is [Maze Game](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/10544966/).


## Closing/ Homework

“Today we covered the basics of using variables and Boolean logic in programming. You are uncovering more about how a program thinks. All programs use this logic. While you are using your electronics this week I want you to think about the if/else statments running the programs we use everyday.”


##Homework
Students can log into Scratch at home and create a game that uses a variable to keep score. This assignment does not technically need to be graded but should be seen as a way for students to explore further into Scratch outside of class.

## After Class
* Prepare for next lesson / hand off to next volunteer in rotation.
